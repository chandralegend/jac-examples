## Description
Assume that you have a Intruder Detection Syste (IDS) connected to your camera feed and you only want to get notified, if there is actually an intruder in the video footage. But currently your system makes false alarms. We are going to create a middleware that get the alarm that is generated by the IDS and confirm whether there is actually an intruder or not and then pass the output to user.

### Todo
- [X] Create a README
- [ ] Create an example IDS using YOLO
- [ ] Create an Middleware
- [ ] Create a simple User Interface using NiceGUI
